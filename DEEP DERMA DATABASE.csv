,ID,Disease,Causes,Symptoms,Treatment Suggestions
0,1,Eczema,"Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is often caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Triggers include allergens, irritants, stress, and climate changes.","Symptoms include dry, itchy, and inflamed skin, often appearing as red or brownish-gray patches. It can also cause thickened, cracked, or scaly skin, and in severe cases, oozing and crusting.","Treatment involves moisturizing creams, topical corticosteroids, and avoiding known triggers. Severe cases may require oral medications or phototherapy."
1,2,Warts and Molluscum,"Both conditions are caused by viral infections. Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), while molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus.","Warts appear as small, grainy skin growths, often rough to the touch. Molluscum presents as small, firm, raised bumps with a dimple in the center.","Treatments include topical treatments like salicylic acid for warts, cryotherapy, laser therapy, or minor surgery. Molluscum may resolve on its own but can be treated with topical therapies or cryotherapy."
2,3,Melanoma,"Melanoma is primarily caused by DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, leading to mutations in the skin cells. Risk factors include excessive sun exposure, tanning beds, and genetic predisposition.","Symptoms include new or unusual growths, changes in existing moles, or sores that don’t heal. Characteristics to watch for include asymmetry, irregular borders, multiple colors, large diameter, and evolving shape or size.","Early-stage melanoma is treated with surgical excision. Advanced stages may require immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Regular skin checks and sun protection are crucial."
3,4,Atopic Dermatitis,"Similar to eczema, atopic dermatitis is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Common triggers include allergens, stress, and irritants.","Symptoms include severe itching, red or brownish patches, dry and scaly skin, and thickened or cracked areas. In some cases, oozing and crusting occur.","Treatment includes moisturizing, topical steroids, and avoiding triggers. Severe cases may need systemic treatments like oral medications or biologic drugs."
4,5,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is caused by prolonged UV radiation exposure, leading to DNA damage in the skin's basal cells. Risk factors include fair skin, excessive sun exposure, and genetic predisposition.","Symptoms include a pearly or waxy bump, a flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, or a sore that bleeds, scabs, and recurs.","Treatment typically involves surgical removal, including Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, topical treatments, or radiation therapy. Regular skin checks and sun protection are essential."
5,6,Melanocytic Nevi,"Melanocytic nevi, or moles, are caused by the proliferation of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells. They can be congenital or acquired, often due to genetic factors and sun exposure.","Typically, they appear as small, dark brown spots. They can be flat or raised, and their color and size may vary.","Generally, no treatment is required unless they change in appearance or cause discomfort. For cosmetic reasons or if malignancy is suspected, they can be removed via excision or laser treatment."
6,7,Benign Keratosis-like Lesions,"These lesions, including seborrheic keratoses, arise from the growth of keratinocytes. The exact cause is unknown, but they are linked to aging and possibly genetics.","Symptoms include well-demarcated, waxy, and wart-like growths that are usually brown, black, or tan. They can be flat or slightly raised.","Treatments include cryotherapy, curettage, laser therapy, or topical treatments like hydrogen peroxide (Eskata) for smaller lesions."
7,8,"Psoriasis, Lichen Planus, and Related Diseases","Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition triggered by an overactive immune system. Lichen planus is also believed to be an autoimmune response, with potential triggers including medications, infections, and stress.","Psoriasis presents with red, scaly patches that can be itchy and painful. Lichen planus appears as purplish, flat-topped bumps, often with a network of white lines.","Psoriasis treatments include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues (calcipotriene), biologics (etanercept, adalimumab), and phototherapy. Lichen planus treatment includes corticosteroids, retinoids, and antihistamines for itching."
8,9,Seborrheic Keratoses,"Seborrheic keratoses are benign skin growths caused by the proliferation of keratinocytes. Their exact cause is unknown, but they are more common with aging.","They appear as waxy, wart-like growths that can range from light tan to black. They are often slightly raised and can have a rough texture.","Treatment is usually cosmetic. Options include cryotherapy, curettage, electrosurgery, and laser therapy."
9,10,Tinea (Ringworm) and Candidiasis,"Tinea (ringworm) is a fungal infection caused by dermatophytes. Candidiasis is caused by the Candida species of fungi. Both are influenced by factors like moisture, heat, and a weakened immune system.","Tinea presents as ring-shaped, red, scaly patches that can be itchy. Candidiasis causes red, moist, and often itchy areas, commonly in skin folds.",Treatment for tinea includes antifungal creams like clotrimazole or terbinafine. Candidiasis treatment involves antifungal medications such as fluconazole or topical clotrimazole. Keeping the affected area dry and clean is also essential.
